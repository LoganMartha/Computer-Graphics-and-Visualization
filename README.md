# Computer Graphics and Visualization

This project is a **3D graphics application** developed in C++ using **OpenGL**, inspired by a 2D image provided by a client. It simulates a 3D environment featuring low-polygon models enhanced with textures and lighting, following best practices in 3D graphics development.

## Key Features

- **3D Objects:** Four objects composed of primitive shapes, with organized geometry and applied textures.
- **Lighting:** Two light sources implementing Phong shading for realistic visual effects.
- **Camera Controls:** Navigate the environment using **WASD** and **QE** keys, with mouse input for camera orientation.
- **Display Options:** Toggle between **perspective** and **orthographic** views via keyboard input.

This project highlights my skills in computational graphics, interactive application design, and adherence to clean coding standards.

## Reflection Questions

**1. How do you approach designing software?**  
I begin by gathering all necessary information and then create diagrams or detailed lists to break down the project into manageable steps. This structured planning helps me tackle each part methodically.

**2. How do you approach developing programs?**  
I like to start with a clear outline in my IDE, including comments and function placeholders. Creating empty source files as needed allows me to focus on coding efficiently without forgetting important components.

**3. How can computer science help me reach my goals?**  
Computer science has taught me the value of solid techniques and planning, especially for large projects that require multiple sessions. Thoughtful planning and using strategies like outlining and modular development are essential to becoming a successful developer.
