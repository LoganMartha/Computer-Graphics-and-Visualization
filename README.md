# Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization

This project is a 3D graphics application developed in C++ using OpenGL, simulating a 3D environment inspired by a 2D image provided by a client. The program generates low-polygon models with textures and lighting, utilizing best practices for 3D graphics development. Key features include:

-  3D Objects: Four objects composed of primitive shapes, with applied textures and organized geometry.
-  Lighting: Two light sources with Phong shading components for polished visualizations.
-  Camera Controls: Navigation using WASD and QE keys for movement, with mouse input for orientation adjustments.
-  Display Options: Toggle between perspective and orthographic views with a keyboard key.

This project showcases my understanding of computational graphics, interactive applications, and best coding practices.
