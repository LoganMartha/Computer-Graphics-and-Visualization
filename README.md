# Computer-Graphics-and-Visualization

This project is a 3D graphics application developed in C++ using OpenGL, simulating a 3D environment inspired by a 2D image provided by a client. The program generates low-polygon models with textures and lighting, utilizing best practices for 3D graphics development. Key features include:

-  3D Objects: Four objects composed of primitive shapes, with applied textures and organized geometry.
-  Lighting: Two light sources with Phong shading components for polished visualizations.
-  Camera Controls: Navigation using WASD and QE keys for movement, with mouse input for orientation adjustments.
-  Display Options: Toggle between perspective and orthographic views with a keyboard key.

This project showcases my understanding of computational graphics, interactive applications, and best coding practices.

**Questions to Answer**
1. How do you approach designing software?
   - When designing any type of software I like to lay out all the information I have gathered that needs to be implemented.  Whether that is creating different diagrams of representation or making detailed lists, doing this allows for me to attack each task in a step-by-step manner that I find most beneficial to me.
2. How do I approach developing programs?
   - Very similarly, I like to get all the information in front of me.  I like to create a basic outline in my IDE to make sure I do not forget anything and can jump around easy if need be.  That may consist of commenting and functions that need to be done, any different source files are created but may be empty.  Making sure I have an outline makes it so I can really focus on the programming and not worry about forgetting an aspect.
3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
   - I have found that computer science has taught me the importance of my techniques.  When dealing with large projects that can not be done in one sitting, you need to be able to create an enviorment for yourself that makes it easy to jump back in at another time.  Making thought out planning tools and using different strategies like I stated in my last two questions answers is needed in order to be a successful developer.
